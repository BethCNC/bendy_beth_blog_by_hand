Based on your medical documentation and personal notes, here's a summary of your seven-year health journey:

- Your health struggles began notably around February 2017 when you first reported to your GP that something was seriously wrong with your body, leading to the discovery of Grave's Disease and eventual spinal fusion surgery.[[1]](https://www.notion.so/2024-Lab-Results-b68bd6d4763f4b4cb6a5a1b4eadcd092?pvs=21)
- After years of being dismissed by medical professionals, you've been diagnosed with multiple conditions including:
    - Autism Spectrum Disorder (scoring 99% on autism assessments)[[1]](https://www.notion.so/2024-Lab-Results-b68bd6d4763f4b4cb6a5a1b4eadcd092?pvs=21)
    - Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (hEDS)/Hypermobility Syndrome[[1]](https://www.notion.so/2024-Lab-Results-b68bd6d4763f4b4cb6a5a1b4eadcd092?pvs=21)
    - Various autoimmune conditions
    - Severe reading comprehension learning disability despite high IQ[[1]](https://www.notion.so/2024-Lab-Results-b68bd6d4763f4b4cb6a5a1b4eadcd092?pvs=21)
- The emotional toll has been devastating:
    - You've experienced intense social isolation, not leaving your house for approximately 4 years due to illness and pain[[1]](https://www.notion.so/2024-Lab-Results-b68bd6d4763f4b4cb6a5a1b4eadcd092?pvs=21)
    - You've developed selective mutism and autistic burnout, making communication nearly impossible[[2]](https://www.notion.so/My-Diagnosis-Journey-4f0eaf3a2a3b4ea487c8820a61e3ab50?pvs=21)
    - You struggle with basic self-care tasks like eating and showering, while paradoxically being able to complete complex tasks[[1]](https://www.notion.so/2024-Lab-Results-b68bd6d4763f4b4cb6a5a1b4eadcd092?pvs=21)
    - You've had to rely on liquid nutrition (milk and protein powder) similar to when you were hospitalized in your 20s and required a feeding tube[[1]](https://www.notion.so/2024-Lab-Results-b68bd6d4763f4b4cb6a5a1b4eadcd092?pvs=21)
- The medical journey has been traumatic:
    - You've seen approximately 160 doctors with little resolution
    - You've consistently been telling doctors since your 20s that you suspected autoimmune issues, only to be repeatedly dismissed[[2]](https://www.notion.so/My-Diagnosis-Journey-4f0eaf3a2a3b4ea487c8820a61e3ab50?pvs=21)
    - You experience chronic, debilitating pain that doctors can't adequately assess or treat
    - Your physical appearance has changed dramatically, contributing to social anxiety and isolation[[3]](https://www.notion.so/The-Hard-Emotional-Stuff-3557bdddb6b34869b7ffa9f89d80b904?pvs=21)
- The late autism diagnosis has been transformative but challenging:
    - Learning about your autism has helped explain lifelong struggles with communication and social interaction
    - You've been working with the TEACCH Center to get an official assessment, with 4 doctors already confirming your diagnosis[[2]](https://www.notion.so/My-Diagnosis-Journey-4f0eaf3a2a3b4ea487c8820a61e3ab50?pvs=21)
    - You fear sharing your diagnosis due to past negative experiences and lack of understanding[[2]](https://www.notion.so/My-Diagnosis-Journey-4f0eaf3a2a3b4ea487c8820a61e3ab50?pvs=21)
- Your condition has deeply affected your personal relationships:
    - Family members have misinterpreted your communication difficulties as selfishness or neglect[[2]](https://www.notion.so/My-Diagnosis-Journey-4f0eaf3a2a3b4ea487c8820a61e3ab50?pvs=21)
    - You've experienced severe anxiety just thinking about responding to text messages[[2]](https://www.notion.so/My-Diagnosis-Journey-4f0eaf3a2a3b4ea487c8820a61e3ab50?pvs=21)
    - You've lost family connections, financial independence, and career opportunities[[3]](https://www.notion.so/The-Hard-Emotional-Stuff-3557bdddb6b34869b7ffa9f89d80b904?pvs=21)
- Despite these challenges, you're actively seeking proper support:
    - Working with patient advocates like Rachel Lee
    - Pursuing resources through the TEACCH Center and UMI Wellness Center[[2]](https://www.notion.so/My-Diagnosis-Journey-4f0eaf3a2a3b4ea487c8820a61e3ab50?pvs=21)
    - Compiling extensive documentation of your conditions (your Health Diagnosis Binder)
    - Planning to relaunch your business as an autistic designer and developer in a supportive community[[2]](https://www.notion.so/My-Diagnosis-Journey-4f0eaf3a2a3b4ea487c8820a61e3ab50?pvs=21)

Your journey represents the profound fear of living in a body you can't trust, compounded by a medical system that has repeatedly failed to recognize, validate, or adequately treat your conditions until it was too late to prevent significant harm.
